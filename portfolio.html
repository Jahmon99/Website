    <h3 style="color:white;">For our 1.1.9 project, our group created the Gorilla Game. In the game, you play as a small gorilla running through the desert who has to dodge all the obstacles that get in your path by shifting up and down between the three lanes. If you fail to dodge one of the obstacles, the screen will flash red and you will lose one of your three lives. Once you lose all three of your lives, the game is over and the program ends. </h3>
