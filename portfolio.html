    <h3 style="color:white;">For our 1.1.9 project, our group created the Gorilla Game. In the game, you play as a small gorilla running through the desert who has to dodge all the obstacles that get in your path by shifting up and down between the three lanes. If you fail to dodge one of the obstacles, the screen will flash red and you will lose one of your three lives. Once you lose all three of your lives, the game is over and the program ends. </h3>

    <h3 style="color:white;">For our 1.2.5 project, our group created the Dice Game. In the game, you have a button that when pressed chooses a random dice roll from a list of images called "DieFaces." The game can be played with multiple players, and whoever rolls the highest score wins. </h3>

    <h3 style="color:white;">For our Scratch project, our group created Dino Jump. In the game, you play as a dinosaur travelling through space jumping from platform to platform trying to reach the goal. If you touch the floor, you die. The experience can vary depending on color preference.

    <img src="images/Rover Graphs.PNG" height="300">
    <h3 style="color:white;">For our 3.1.6 project, our group sketched out 20 different graphs according to different sets of environmental conditions and were tasked with matching the graphs our numbers created with the cooresponding environment. We concluded that the set of graphs best fits the "Marsh Lands" based on the graphs we sketched.

    <h3 style="color:white;">For our 3.2.4 project, our group separated and organized sets of honey production data into different categorized graphs based on different factors and experimented with the "groupby" function.

    <img src="images/green cone.PNG" height="300"> <img src="images/red sphere.PNG" height="300">
    <h3 style="color:white;">For our 4.1.4 project, our group selected and analyzed a new simulation in the NetLogo program. We chose the simulation "3D Solids." The program randomly generates turtles about the shell of the shape in either cartesian (x, y, z) or spherical (theta, phi, z) coordinates, depending on which is easier to accomplish but always stores the information converting when necessary in spherical coordinates.
